## 💡 Key Points to Remember

1. **PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md is authoritative** - Everything flows through it
2. **.INSTRUCTIONS.md has the rules** - I follow them automatically
3. **documentation/PYCHARM_INSTRUCTIONS.md has templates** - Use them for chats
4. **Every chat updates PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md** - No stale documentation
5. **System is persistent** - Instructions in repo, not in chat memory

---

## ✅ Before Your First PyCharm Chat

- [ ] Read documentation/PYCHARM_INSTRUCTIONS.md (5 min)
- [ ] Understand the workflow
- [ ] Bookmark the file locations
- [ ] Know which template you'll use

---

## 🎯 Golden Rule

> **PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md is the single source of truth.**
> **Every decision flows through it.**
> **Every chat updates it.**
> **Every developer references it.**

---

## 💬 Example Chat Start

```
I want to implement [Feature Name].

Following documentation/PYCHARM_INSTRUCTIONS.md and .INSTRUCTIONS.md rules:
- Using PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md as authoritative reference
- Will update PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md after implementation

Feature: [Description]
Success: [How you'll know it's done]
```
